This is a sequence development acquisition where we were testing  a multiband DWI acquisition as well as a magnetization transfer sequence for use in a neuromelanin-sensitive acquisition protocol. 

T1w and T2w images were used in Freesurfer 7.4.1 and diffusion data were pre-processed with QSIprep v. 0.21.4
